# NHS AI Lab Skunkworks project: AI Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Pathology Scanning PoC.

> A pilot project for the NHS AI (Artificial Intelligence) Lab Skunkworks team, "AI Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Pathology Scanning PoC" (Automatic segmentation and detection of Parkinson‚Äôs disease pathology using synthetic staining and deep neural networks).

"AI Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Pathology Scanning PoC" was selected as a project in 2022 following a successful pitch to the AI Skunkworks problem-sourcing programme.

## Intended Use

This proof of concept ([TRL 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level)) is intended to demonstrate the technical validity of applying Machine Learning techniques to a dataset from Imperial College's Brain Bank in order detect Parkinson‚Äôs disease pathology. It is not intended for deployment in a clinical or non-clinical setting without further development and compliance with the [UK Medical Device Regulations 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/contents/made) where the product qualifies as a medical device.

## Data Protection

This project was subject to a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), ensuring the protection of the data used in line with the [UK Data Protection Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted) and [UK GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/dp-at-the-end-of-the-transition-period/data-protection-and-the-eu-in-detail/the-uk-gdpr/). No data or trained models are shared in this repository.

## Background

The identification of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease (PD) from post-mortem brain slices is time consuming for highly trained neuropathologists. Accurate classification and stratification of PD can often take hours per case and is required for the development of research into therapeutics, understanding the progression of PD, and for establishing cause of death.

[Parkinson‚Äôs UK](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/) Brain Bank, operating in partnership with [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), has produced a dataset containing digitised slices of brains exhibiting various stages of PD pathology; along with control cases, some of which have associated pathology and others which are neurotypical. This dataset is much larger (over 400 cases), more consistent, and of higher quality (all have been stained with the same protocol and imaged within the same laboratory) than has been documented elsewhere in the literature; including those found in a meta-analysis study on detection of neurological disorders containing over 200 papers (Lima et al., 2022).

The project team, consisting of neuroscientists and subject matter experts from [Imperial](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), [NHS AI Lab Skunkworks](https://transform.england.nhs.uk/ai-lab/), [Parkinson‚Äôs UK](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/), and [Polygeist](https://polygei.st) have undertaken a 12 week project through the Home Office‚Äôs [Accelerated Capability Environment (ACE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/accelerated-capability-environment-ace) to examine the possibility of producing a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) tool to automatically load, enhance and ultimately classify those brain scans. The initial focus of the project was to make a tool that could make a biomarker of PD, the protein ùõº-synuclein (ùõº-syn), more visible to the pathologist; saving time in searching for the protein manually. This goal was quickly reached, producing a tool that could ‚Äòsynthetically stain‚Äô the ùõº-syn, marking regions of interest in a high-contrast bright green, making them quickly identifiable for the pathologist. Statistical analysis of the synthetically stained images showed that very few regions in the control group were stained compared to the PD group, raising the possibility that an automatic classifier could be developed, which became a stretch goal for the project.

## Report

A [full report](docs/report.pdf) including background, model selection, performance metrics and known limitations, and detailing the data pipeline/processes employed is included in this repository.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository (and its submodules) ***TODO: revise url here and for report.pdf above upon publication***
- ```git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:nhsx/skunkworks-parkinsons-detection.git```
2. Download the colorization model weights (run in the project root folder)
- ```wget http://colorization.eecs.berkeley.edu/siggraph/models/caffemodel.pth -O ext/ideepcolor/models/pytorch/caffemodel.pth```
3. Create the virtual environment as below

## Environment Setup
The system has been developed on Ubuntu 20.04.4 with the following prerequisites:
- build-essential, wget, git, git-lfs, python3-dev, cmake, libpng-dev, libjpeg-dev, and the CUDA toolkit version 11.3-7.

To create the virtual environment, run:
```shell
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-apex.txt

ipython kernel install --name "local-venv" --user
```
Before using the utilities the project must be added to the Python path for each new shell.
```shell
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)"  # Run in the project root folder
```
If the NVIDIA APEX build/install fails for the current environment, manual installation can be completed as follows:
```shell
cd ext/apex
CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.3 pip install -v \
  --disable-pip-version-check \
  --no-cache-dir \
  --global-option="--cpp_ext" \
  --global-option="--cuda_ext" \
  ./
```
The codebase performs three functions (artificial staining, classifier training and inference) these are demonstrated through the following three aspects:
1. [A Python API](html/index.html) (only local viewing is available, not via GitHub)
2. [A Jupyter Notebook](notebook/stain_and_train_for_DMNoV.ipynb) (to be viewed via ```jupyter-lab```), and
3. [A CLI walkthrough](walkthrough/README.md) (examples to be run from command line)

*Note:* A GPU is required to run these examples. The work has been developed and tested using an NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB).
